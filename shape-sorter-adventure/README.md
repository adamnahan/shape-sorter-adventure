# Shape Sorter Adventure: An Inclusive Game for Motor Impairments

## Overview

"Shape Sorter Adventure" is an accessible educational game designed for young children (ages 3-6) with motor impairments, especially those who may find traditional mouse-and-keyboard interactions challenging. The game focuses on basic shape recognition and sorting, but its core innovation lies in its **single-switch accessibility**. Players can interact with the entire game using just one input device (e.g., a large button, a head switch, or the spacebar).

## Accessibility Features

* **Single-Switch Input:** The entire game is playable with a single input (Spacebar by default). This makes it accessible for users with limited fine motor control.
* **Scanning Interface:** Items on the screen (the current shape and target slots) are highlighted sequentially, allowing the user to select the desired item by pressing the single switch when it's highlighted.
    * First, the current shape is highlighted. Selecting it switches the scanning to the target slots.
    * Then, the target slots are highlighted one by one. Selecting the correct slot completes the turn.
* **Clear Visual Feedback:** Bright, high-contrast highlighting clearly indicates the currently scannable item.
* **Auditory Cues:**
    * The name of the current shape is spoken aloud when it appears.
    * Positive sounds for correct matches and gentle feedback for incorrect attempts.
* **Simplified Gameplay:** The task of sorting shapes is cognitively straightforward, reducing mental load and allowing focus on the interaction.

## How to Play

1.  A shape will appear at the top. Its name will be spoken aloud.
2.  The game will start **scanning** (highlighting) the current shape, and then the target slots one by one.
3.  When the **current shape** is highlighted, press the **Spacebar** (or your connected single switch) to select it.
4.  Once the shape is selected, the scanning will switch to the **target slots**.
5.  When the **correct target slot** (the one matching the current shape) is highlighted, press the **Spacebar** to drop the shape in.
6.  If you choose the wrong slot, you'll hear an "incorrect" sound and can try again.
7.  A correct match will give you a point, play a "correct" sound, and a new shape will appear.
